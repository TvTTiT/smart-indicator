The energy indicator will be able to indicate information about energy status to the user. This will be done using an internet connection. 

## Getting started
This project uses Espressif's embedded framework called "ESP IDF". This framework is used to write, build, flash, and debug embedded applications on ESP SoC and is required to use this project. A tutorial on how to install and use it can be found at [Esp Idf: Getting started](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/index.html)
