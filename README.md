# smart-indicator
This project is an integral component of the H2020 Serene project. The indicator is designed to visually represent the solar panel energy production data of residents in Olst.
This will be done by getting the energy data through API and displaying it with LEDs.
The documentation about the API can be found at [https://openweathermap.org/api].

## Getting started
This project uses Espressif's embedded framework called "ESP IDF". This framework is used to write, build, flash, and debug embedded applications on ESP SoC and is required to use this project. A tutorial on how to install and use it can be found at [Esp Idf: Getting started](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/index.html)
